# Tutorial

## Introduction 
In tutorial pages, I'd like to introduce usage 
of ``figpptx`` and how to extend functionality
of this library.  

I feel it is sufficient for most users 
to only know ``send`` and ``rasterize`` functions.
To know basic usage, please read to the following page.  

* [Basic Usage](./basic.md)

I hope simple calls of these functions become helpful to you.
Nevertheless, it may not satisfy your requirements.
Especially, default settings of ``send`` function reflects 
tastes of the author strongly, so it may contradict against 
your desires. 

If you feel improvements or modification are required for each case, 
please modify them to your advantages.  
First of all, [Overview of Design](../concept/index.md) is helpful for customization.

In addition, I'd like to leave some sample codes for extension.  

* [Separator Example](separator.md)
* [Converter Example](converter.md)
